    description: |
      A catalog is the first layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace. It’s used to organize your data assets.
  - name: Schemas
    description: |
      A schema (also called a database) is the second layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace. A schema organizes tables, volumes and functions.
  - name: Tables
    description: |
      A table resides in the third layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace. It contains rows of data. 
      A table can be managed or external.
  - name: Volumes
    description: |
      Volumes are a Unity Catalog capability for accessing, storing, governing, organizing and processing files. Use cases include running machine learning on unstructured data such as image, audio, video, or PDF files, organizing data sets during the data exploration stages in data science, working with libraries that require access to the local file system on cluster machines, storing library and config files of arbitrary formats such as .whl or .txt centrally and providing secure access across workspaces to it, or transforming and querying non-tabular data files in ETL.
  - name: Functions
    description: |
      Functions implement User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in Unity Catalog.
      The function implementation can be a SQL expression/query or a python function, and it can be invoked wherever a table reference is allowed in a query.
      In Unity Catalog, a function resides at the same level as a table, so it can be referenced with the form __catalog_name__.__schema_name__.__function_name__.
  - name: RegisteredModels
    description: |
      Registered models are machine learning models that are stored within the Unity Catalog model registry. They are comprised of all versions of a single model that a user wishes to keep.
      A registered model resides in the third layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace, and can be referenced with the form __catalog_name__.__schema_name__.__model_name__.
  - name: ModelVersions
    description: |
      Model versions contain all artifact files associated with an individual machine learning model. They are associated with a single parent model and have an integer identifier, indicating the version number of the model.
      Model versions are referenced via model URI's using the Unity Catalog three-level namespace of the registered model and the version identifier.
  - name: TemporaryCredentials
    description: |
      Temporary credentials are used to access storage locations or assets for a limited lifetime.
  - name: Permissions
    description: |
      In Unity Catalog, data is secure by default. Access can be granted.
  - name: Metastores
    description: |
      A metastore is the top-level container of objects in Unity Catalog that stores all UC assets.
