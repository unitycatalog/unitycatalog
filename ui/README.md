You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Authenticate and Login

OSS Unity Catalog supports Sign in with Google. You can authenticate with Google by clicking the "Sign in with Google" button on the login page, once OAuth has been configured. To configure this, follow the steps to obtain a [Google API Client ID](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid) and configure your OAuth consent screen.

NOTE: The google client ID should match what is configured in the server.properties file on the server side. See README in root directory. In order for login to work, authentication must be enabled on server side AND UI side and users must be added to users table.

Once you have the client ID, add it to the `.env` file after `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=` and change the `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` flag from false to true. Restart yarn.
