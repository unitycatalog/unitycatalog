# AI reviewer prompts

Each reviewer bundle uses its adjacent `REVIEW.md` as the executable Omnigent prompt through
`instructions: REVIEW.md` in `config.yaml`. Changes to those Markdown files therefore change the
CI review behavior.

To run a reviewer locally, load its `config.yaml` bundle and provide the PR metadata and diff as
review context.

Each published inline finding includes feedback instructions: react 👍 for helpful or 👎 for
unhelpful or incorrect, or 👀 for out of scope. Feedback remains
on the comment for manual review and prompt tuning; the workflow does not automatically consume
these ratings or learn from them. The footer is excluded from exact finding deduplication.
