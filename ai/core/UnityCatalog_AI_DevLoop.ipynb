    "## Crafting Your First Unity Catalog Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in our development workflow is creating an initial function to register in Unity Catalog. We'll define a function for calculating stellar properties based on astrophysical parameters - a perfect example to showcase how Unity Catalog AI handles complex scientific functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function simulates stellar evolution in a simplified way, calculating key properties like:\n",
    "- Current mass (after accounting for stellar mass loss over time)\n",
    "- Luminosity (how bright the star is compared to our Sun)\n",
    "- Surface temperature (in Kelvin)\n",
    "- Evolutionary stage (from protostar through main sequence and beyond to end states like white dwarf or black hole)\n",
    "\n",
    "While this uses simplified models compared to sophisticated stellar evolution codes used in astrophysics research, it demonstrates how domain expertise can be packaged into a callable function that AI assistants can leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the comprehensive docstring in our function definition. This is critical for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GenAI Integration**: Unity Catalog AI parses these docstrings to create proper tool definitions when integrating with LLMs like Claude, Gemini, or GPT models. The better your documentation, the more effectively AI agents can understand and use your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Developer Experience**: Clear parameter descriptions, return value documentation, and usage examples make your functions more maintainable and easier for other team members to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 releases include enhanced docstring parsing abilities, giving you better control over how your functions appear as tools to AI agents. This function includes parameter validation, meaningful error messages, and clear documentation of parameter constraints - all best practices when creating functions for AI systems."

    "1. **Code Inspection**: Quickly review how existing functions work without having to search through your codebase\n",
    "2. **Iterative Development**: Make improvements to functions that are already registered\n",

    "\n",
    "The `get_function_source()` API solves a significant pain point in the Unity Catalog development workflow. Behind the scenes, Unity Catalog stores functions as complex `FunctionInfo` objects that split the function signature, docstring, and body into separate constituent parts within a nested structure. Manually extracting and reconstructing a complete function from this representation is tedious, error-prone, and requires deep knowledge of the internal data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `get_function_source()`, you get back a properly formatted Python function as a string - ready to be modified or used as a template for new functions. This seemingly simple capability eliminates what was previously a frustrating and error-prone manual process of copying metadata fields from complex nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we retrieve the full definition of our stellar properties function. Notice that the entire function, including comments and docstrings, is preserved exactly as it was registered. This allows us to make targeted improvements while maintaining the function's interface and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scientific and analytics workflows, functions often evolve as models are refined and improved. The `get_function_source()` API makes this evolution smoother by providing a clear starting point for enhancements."

    "## Registering the Enhanced Function to Unity Catalog\n",

    "After developing our enhanced stellar properties function with additional astrophysical parameters, we need to register it to Unity Catalog to make it available for AI assistants and other applications. This step highlights another powerful aspect of the Unity Catalog AI workflow - the ability to maintain multiple versions or variants of related functions within the same catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The registration process for our enhanced function follows the same pattern we used earlier. We call `create_python_function()` with our new enhanced function, using the same catalog and schema but a different function name. Once registered, we store the fully qualified function name for later use.\n",

    "3. **Complex Calculation Preservation**: It accurately captures all of our sophisticated astrophysics calculations\n",
    "4. **Local Module Handling**: It properly manages the `math` module that's imported within the function\n",

    "- The enhanced function for more detailed astrophysical analysis\n",

    "## Executing the Enhanced Function with Test Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "After registering our enhanced stellar function with Unity Catalog, we need to validate it with a comprehensive set of test scenarios. This testing phase is critical to ensure our function behaves as expected across the parameter space that AI assistants might explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our enhanced stellar properties function, we've selected four representative scenarios that showcase different stellar types and evolutionary stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sun-like Star**: A G-type main sequence star with solar metallicity and middle age (1.0 M‚òâ)\n",
    "2. **Massive O-Type Star**: A young, high-mass star that will eventually form a black hole (25.0 M‚òâ)\n",
    "3. **Low-mass Red Dwarf**: A common, long-lived, cool star (0.3 M‚òâ)\n",
    "4. **Evolved Massive Star**: An old, massive star that has already formed a black hole (90.5 M‚òâ)\n",
    "\n",
    "These scenarios test our function across orders of magnitude in stellar mass and through different evolutionary stages, from young main sequence stars to evolved stellar remnants.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, we:\n",
    "1. Call the function via `execute_function()` with the appropriate parameters\n",
    "2. Parse the returned string representation into a Python dictionary\n",
    "3. Display all the calculated stellar properties for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic testing approach helps catch edge cases and ensures that both fundamental properties (mass, luminosity, temperature) and our enhanced properties (spectral type, habitable zone, magnetic field strength) are calculated correctly for all stellar types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing different evolutionary stages is particularly important for functions that model time-dependent processes. Our test set includes stars in various life stages, from young stars to those that have already completed their evolution, ensuring our function handles the entire stellar lifecycle appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation step provides confidence that when AI assistants or data scientists use our function, it will produce scientifically sound results across the entire parameter space."

    "## Creating Independent Black Hole Physics Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the power of function wrapping, let's shift our focus from stellar astrophysics to black hole physics. In this section, we'll create a set of independent functions that calculate various properties of black holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions represents a distinct physical calculation related to black holes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schwarzschild Radius**: Calculates the event horizon radius (the \"point of no return\") for a black hole of a given mass\n",
    "2. **Hawking Temperature**: Determines the quantum mechanical thermal radiation emitted by black holes\n",
    "3. **Event Horizon Area**: Computes the surface area of the event horizon, which relates to black hole entropy\n",
    "4. **Accretion Luminosity**: Estimates the energy output from matter falling into a black hole\n",
    "5. **Eddington Luminosity**: Calculates the theoretical maximum luminosity a black hole can achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are designed to be independently useful while also serving as building blocks for more comprehensive analyses. Each function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepts clear, well-defined parameters with validation\n",
    "- Performs a specific calculation based on established physics equations\n",
    "- Returns a single, specific physical property\n",
    "- Includes comprehensive documentation explaining its purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach to function development follows scientific best practices by isolating specific physical phenomena into discrete, testable units. Each function can be validated against known solutions and used independently when only a specific property is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When registering these functions with Unity Catalog, they become individually accessible to AI assistants and other applications. This granularity allows AI systems to select exactly the function they need based on user queries - a question about black hole temperature would invoke just the Hawking temperature function, while a question about accretion would use the relevant accretion function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach also makes the functions more maintainable, as updates to one physical calculation don't affect the others. For example, if a more accurate formula for Hawking radiation is developed, we can update just that function without touching the others."

    "## Testing Individual Functions Before Wrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Before consolidating our functions into a wrapper, it's crucial to register and test each component function independently. This step ensures that each calculation works correctly on its own and helps isolate any issues before they propagate to more complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unity Catalog AI makes this process straightforward with the `create_python_function` API, which allows us to register each function with just a single call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for func in [schwarzschild_radius, hawking_temperature, event_horizon_area, \n",
    "             accretion_luminosity, eddington_luminosity]:\n",
    "    client.create_python_function(catalog=CATALOG, schema=SCHEMA, func=func, replace=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several key benefits for the development workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incremental Testing**: You can validate each specialized calculation separately\n",
    "2. **Independent Accessibility**: AI agents and other systems can call individual functions when they only need specific calculations\n",
    "3. **Clearer Debugging**: Issues can be pinpointed to specific functions rather than troubleshooting the entire wrapper\n",
    "4. **Versioning Flexibility**: You can update individual functions without necessarily having to update the wrapper\n",
    "\n",

    "## Function Wrapping: Creating Integrated Solutions with Minimal Code Duplication\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features introduced in Unity Catalog AI 0.3.0 is the `create_wrapped_function` API. This capability solves a fundamental challenge in modular programming: how to combine specialized functions into more powerful composite functions without duplicating code. Let's explore how this works in the context of our black hole physics library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Function Dependencies in Unity Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "Unity Catalog functions are registered independently and can't directly call each other within the catalog environment. This creates a dilemma when you need functions to build on each other's results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You could **duplicate logic** across functions, but this leads to maintenance nightmares\n",
    "2. You could make **client-side calls** between functions, but this adds latency and complexity\n",
    "3. You could maintain **separate codebases** for individual functions and composites, but this creates version drift\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Automatic Function Wrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_wrapped_function` API elegantly solves this problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatically injecting** the source code of dependent functions\n",
    "2. **Preserving direct function calls** in your wrapper logic\n",
    "3. **Creating a single consolidated function** in Unity Catalog that contains all necessary code\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, you can:\n",
    "- Develop and test each component function independently\n",
    "- Combine them into powerful composite solutions\n",
    "- Maintain all functions from a single codebase\n",
    "- Avoid code duplication and synchronization challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "In our black hole physics example, the `black_hole_analyzer` wrapper directly calls the five specialized functions (`schwarzschild_radius`, `event_horizon_area`, etc.) as if they were locally available. When registered with `create_wrapped_function`, the system automatically injects all necessary function code to make a self-contained composite function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly valuable for scientific and analytical workflows, where complex analyses often build upon layers of specialized calculations. The wrapper can focus on integration logic and derived calculations while leveraging the specialized expertise in each component function."

    "One of the most powerful security enhancements in Unity Catalog AI 0.3.0 is the improved sandbox execution mode. This feature provides critical protection for production systems by isolating potentially hazardous function executions in separate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Sandbox Protection Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with AI agents that can call arbitrary functions, you face a fundamental challenge: users might unknowingly (or deliberately) provide parameters that could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crash your system** with unbounded computational demands\n",
    "2. **Lock up resources** with infinite loops or excessive memory usage\n",
    "3. **Access sensitive system resources** through imported modules\n",
    "4. **Block other operations** by monopolizing computational resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The sandbox execution mode creates a protective barrier by running functions in isolated processes with strict resource limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Sandbox Protection Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll demonstrate how the sandbox works by creating a deliberately resource-intensive function: a Mandelbrot set calculator. While this function is perfectly safe with reasonable parameters, it can consume enormous computational resources when given large dimensions or iteration counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sandbox protection system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Runs code in isolated processes** rather than in the main application process\n",
    "2. **Enforces CPU time limits** to prevent excessive computation\n",
    "3. **Restricts memory usage** to prevent memory exhaustion\n",
    "4. **Blocks access to sensitive system modules** like `os`, `sys`, and `subprocess`\n",
    "5. **Imposes execution timeouts** to ensure functions terminate\n",
    "\n",
    "For our demonstration, we've customized the timeout to just 3 seconds (compared to the default 30 seconds) to show how quickly the system can respond to potentially problematic executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This protection is especially important for GenAI applications, where large language models might explore edge cases or extreme parameters that human users would typically avoid. By configuring the sandbox mode appropriately, you can ensure that even the most computationally demanding function calls will fail gracefully rather than bringing down your entire application."

    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Computational Complexity Warning: Mandelbrot Set Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mandelbrot_set_calculator` function provides a fascinating mathematical tool for generating the famous Mandelbrot set fractal. However, it presents significant computational challenges that make it a perfect example of why unrestricted function execution in AI agents can be dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Computational Complexity Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "- **O(width √ó height √ó max_iterations)** - This is a cubic growth pattern in the worst case\n",
    "- With maximum allowed parameters (5000√ó5000 pixels, 100,000 iterations), this results in **2.5 trillion operations**\n",
    "- A single call with large parameters can monopolize CPU resources for minutes or even hours\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Consumption\n",
    "- Creates a NumPy array of size `width √ó height √ó 4 bytes` (for int32)\n",
    "- At maximum dimensions (5000√ó5000), requires **~95MB** just for the result matrix\n",
    "- Additional memory overhead for the Python lists created for JSON serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dangers in GenAI Agent Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "If an AI agent has unrestricted access to execute this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: A user could easily (intentionally or unintentionally) trigger a computation that paralyzes the main application process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resource Starvation**: A single request with parameters like `width=5000, height=5000, max_iterations=100000` could consume all available CPU resources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unpredictable Response Times**: Even with moderate parameters, execution time varies dramatically based on the specific region of the complex plane being calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Exhaustion**: Large result matrices can consume significant memory, potentially causing OOM (Out of Memory) errors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safeguard Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why process/queue-based sandbox execution with the following protections is essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU Limits**: Restrict the maximum CPU time any single calculation can consume\n",
    "- **Memory Caps**: Prevent memory usage from exceeding predefined thresholds\n",
    "- **Execution Timeouts**: Automatically terminate calculations that exceed time limits\n",
    "- **Process Isolation**: Run computationally intensive functions in separate processes to protect the main application\n",
    "- **Queue Management**: Prevent queue flooding by limiting concurrent intensive operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these two parameter sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `width=100, height=100, max_iterations=1000`\n",
    "   - ~10 million operations\n",
    "   - Completes almost instantly\n",
    "   - Memory usage: ~40KB\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `width=5000, height=5000, max_iterations=50000`\n",
    "   - ~1.25 trillion operations\n",
    "   - Could take hours on standard hardware\n",
    "   - Memory usage: ~95MB\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper safeguards, the second example could effectively crash or freeze your application."

    "## Sandbox Protection: Safeguarding Against Runaway Computations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant security enhancements in Unity Catalog AI 0.3.0 is the improved sandbox execution mode. This feature provides critical protection for production systems when integrating with AI agents or handling user-provided parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Dangerous Function Executions\n",
    "\n",
    "When exposing functions to AI agents or end users, several risks emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Functions with unbounded computation can consume all available CPU or memory\n",
    "2. **Denial of Service**: Poorly parameterized functions can effectively lock up your system\n",
    "3. **System Access**: Malicious code might attempt to access sensitive system resources\n",
    "4. **Infinite Loops**: Functions without proper termination conditions can run indefinitely\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues are particularly concerning with GenAI applications because large language models may explore edge cases or suggest extreme parameters that could unintentionally stress your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Process Isolation with Resource Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "The sandbox execution mode in Unity Catalog AI 0.3.0 provides comprehensive protection through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Isolation**: Functions run in separate processes rather than in your main application\n",
    "2. **Resource Limitations**:\n",
    "  - **CPU Time Limits**: Restricts total CPU time consumption\n",
    "  - **Memory Caps**: Prevents memory exhaustion\n",
    "  - **Execution Timeouts**: Forces termination after a specified wall clock time\n",
    "3. **Module Restrictions**: Blocks access to dangerous system modules like `os`, `sys`, and `subprocess`\n",
    "4. **File Access Prevention**: Disables the built-in `open()` function to prevent filesystem access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Through Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The sandbox protection system is highly configurable through environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT`: Maximum wall clock time (in seconds) before termination\n",
    "- `EXECUTOR_MAX_CPU_TIME_LIMIT`: Maximum CPU time (in seconds)\n",
    "- `EXECUTOR_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT`: Maximum memory usage (in MB)\n",
    "- `EXECUTOR_DISALLOWED_MODULES`: Comma-separated list of modules to block\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated in our example, you can adjust these settings to match your specific requirements and risk tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mandelbrot Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Mandelbrot set calculator provides a perfect demonstration of how sandbox protection works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With modest parameters (50x50 pixels), the function completes quickly and returns valid results\n",
    "- With extreme parameters (3000x3000 pixels), the computation would normally consume significant resources and time\n",
    "- The sandbox detects the excessive computation and terminates it after our configured 3-second timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "This protection mechanism ensures that even if an AI agent or user submits problematic parameters, your system remains responsive and stable. The function simply fails gracefully with a timeout message rather than bringing down your entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For production GenAI applications, this layer of protection is essential when exposing computational functions to large language models, which might not inherently understand the resource implications of the parameters they suggest."
