# Changelog for Unity Catalog AI releases

## Unity Catalog AI 0.2.0

The 0.2.0 release of Unity Catalog AI brings some exciting new functionality for using Unity Catalog for GenAI function execution.

### Major Changes

- [unitycatalog-autogen](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-autogen) has been overhauled to support the new `0.4.x` overhaul of [AutoGen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/). Support for earlier versions of the `autogen` or `pyautogen` packages has been dropped. To read more about what this reimagining of the library is all about and to learn how to migrate to the new APIs, see [this post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/autogen-v0-4-reimagining-the-foundation-of-agentic-ai-for-scale-extensibility-and-robustness/).
- [unitycatalog-gemini](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-gemini) has been released. You can now use Unity Catalog functions as tools when interfacing with Gemini models that support tool calling.
- [unitycatalog-litellm](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-litellm) has been released. You can now interface with the universal common interface of LiteLLM to pass tool usage definitions to integrated providers in LiteLLM that support tool calling.
- New APIs have been added for function wrapping. This change eliminates the need for making multiple copies of utility functions that need to be embedded in your Unity Catalog functions, greatly simplifying the devloop for authoring. See the documentation for examples on how to use these new APIs!
- The Databricks Unity Catalog Client now only supports serverless endpoints using dbconnect for all CRUD and execution APIs. This change aims to simpilfy the usage of the client APIs and to reduce latency in cold start scenarios.
- Support for `requirements`, `environment_version` and `Variant` type have been added to the Databricks client. Ensure that the runtime that you are using supports these features to leverage the power of dependency management and JSON-like inputs and outputs to your functions.

## Unity Catalog AI 0.1.0

We are excited to announce the initial release of Unity Catalog AI! This initial release covers the following features and packages.

Packages included in this release:

- [unitycatalog-ai](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-ai/) - the core client package for function CRUD operations and execution of functions as GenAI tools.
- [unitycatalog-langchain](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-langchain/) - Integration package that allows for using UC functions as tools within [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph).
- [unitycatalog-llamaindex](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-llamaindex/) - Integration package for using UC functions as Agent tools within [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index).
- [unitycatalog-openai](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-openai/) - Integration package to utilize tool calling functionality with the [OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).
- [unitycatalog-anthropic](https://pypi.org/project/unitycatalog-anthropic/) - Integration package to allow Claude models to use UC functions as tools with the [Anthropic SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python).

### Unity Catalog Functions Client

The `unitycatalog-ai` package contains the interface for connecting to either a Unity Catalog server or a managed Databricks Unity Catalog service.
With this library, you can:

- Create Catalogs and Schemas
- List and Delete Unity Catalog Functions
- Create Unity Catalog functions from Python Callable definitions
- Execute a Unity Catalog Function

The client that is created within this package is used within the integration packages listed below to retrieve and execute tool calls from GenAI applications.

### Integration Packages

The initial release of the integration packages allows for seamless definition of GenAI tools within agent code for GenAI applications. The unified `UCFunctionToolkit` interface is identical among all of them, providing a unified tool definition interface that will interact with each of the integrated libraries without any complex tool handling code required.
