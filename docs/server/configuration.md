# Unity Catalog Server Configuration

This is the  Unity Catalog server implementation that can be run in the cloud or started locally.

## Running the Server

To run against the latest main branch, start by cloning the open source Unity Catalog GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:unitycatalog/unitycatalog.git
```

To run Unity Catalog, you need **Java 17** installed on your machine. You can always run the `java --version` command
to verify that you have the right version of Java installed such as the following example output.

```sh
% java --version
openjdk 17.0.12 2024-07-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 17.0.12+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 17.0.12+0, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Change into the `unitycatalog` directory and run `bin/start-uc-server` to instantiate the server. Here is what you
should see:

```console

```

The server can be started by issuing the below command from the project root directory:

```sh
bin/start-uc-server
```

!!! note "Running Unity Catalog Server on a specific port"
    To run the server on a specific port, use the `-p` or `--port` option followed by the port number:

    ```sh title="Use -p or --port to specify your port"
    bin/start-uc-server -p <port_number>
    bin/start-uc-server -port <port_number>
    ```

    If no port is specified, the server defaults to port **8080**.

## Configuration

The server config file is at the location `etc/conf/server.properties` (relative to the project root).

- `server.env`: The environment in which the server is running. This can be set to `dev` or `test`. When set to `test`
    the server will instantiate an empty in-memory h2 database for storing metadata. If set to `dev`, the server will
    use the file `etc/db/h2db.mv.db` as the metadata store. Any changes made to the metadata will be persisted in this
    file.

## Logging

The server logs are located at `etc/logs/server.log`. The log level and log rolling policy can be set in log4j2 config
file: `etc/conf/server.log4j2.properties`.
