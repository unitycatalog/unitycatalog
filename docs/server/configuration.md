# Unity Catalog Server Configuration

This is the  Unity Catalog server implementation that can be run in the cloud or started locally.

## Running the Server

To run against the latest main branch, start by cloning the open source Unity Catalog GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:unitycatalog/unitycatalog.git
```

To run Unity Catalog, you need **Java 17** installed on your machine. You can always run the `java --version` command
to verify that you have the right version of Java installed such as the following example output.

```sh
% java --version
openjdk 17.0.12 2024-07-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 17.0.12+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 17.0.12+0, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Change into the `unitycatalog` directory and run `bin/start-uc-server` to instantiate the server. Here is what you
should see:

```console

```

The server can be started by issuing the below command from the project root directory:

```sh
bin/start-uc-server
```

!!! note "Running Unity Catalog Server on a specific port"
    To run the server on a specific port, use the `-p` or `--port` option followed by the port number:

    ```sh title="Use -p or --port to specify your port"
    bin/start-uc-server -p <port_number>
    bin/start-uc-server -port <port_number>
    ```

    If no port is specified, the server defaults to port **8080**.

## Configuration

The server config file is at the location `etc/conf/server.properties` (relative to the project root).

- `server.env`: The environment in which the server is running. This can be set to `dev` or `test`. When set to `test`
    the server will instantiate an empty in-memory h2 database for storing metadata. If set to `dev`, the server will
    use the file `etc/db/h2db.mv.db` as the metadata store. Any changes made to the metadata will be persisted in this
    file.

For enabling server to vend AWS temporary credentials to access S3 buckets (for accessing External tables/volumes),
the following parameters need to be set:

- `s3.bucketPath.i`: The S3 path of the bucket where the data is stored. Should be in the format `s3://<bucket-name>`.
- `s3.accessKey.i`: The AWS access key, an identifier of temp credentials.
- `s3.secretKey.i`: The AWS secret key used to sign API requests to AWS.
- `s3.sessionToken.i`: THE AWS session token, used to verify that the request is coming from a trusted source.

You can configure multiple buckets by incrementing the index *i* in the above parameters. The starting index should
be 0.

All the above parameters are required for each index. For vending temporary credentials, the server matches the bucket
path in the table/volume storage_location with the bucket path in the configuration and returns the corresponding
access key, secret key, and session token.

Any params that are not required can be left empty.

## Logging

The server logs are located at `etc/logs/server.log`. The log level and log rolling policy can be set in log4j2 config
file: `etc/conf/server.log4j2.properties`.

## Authentication and Authorization

Please refer to [Authentication and Authorization](./auth.md) section for more information.
